How To run
==============
Running the Starter Code should be Fairly Simple
make
./example <request.txt>

We have provided to sample Requests
sample_request_example
sample_request_realistic

The given parser is only able to parse sample_request_example. You will need to
modify the rules of the grammar in parser.y to support the spec and also support malformed requests.

TODO
++The parser should handle entire HTTP 1.1 Request Spec
++You must also handle malformed requests
++Keep in mind that the HTTP 1.1 Spec requires you to support request pipelining
